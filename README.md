# winjswebsite
My website writen using WinJS, TypeScript, and an MVVM framework called TypedMVVM 

I haven't seen many examples of WinJS being used on an actual website for the browser.  Most samples are for webapps: native apps for Windows Store or Cordova-based.  Here's my trial-and-error website that uses WinJS.  I really like TypeScript so I'll be using TypeScript as much as possible.  Finally, having written MVVM apps in C# for a while, I can't get out of the habit of using that pattern so I'll be using Davide Zordan's TypedMVVM framework.
